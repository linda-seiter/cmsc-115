## Task 1 - SeafoodMarket.java

Double click on `SeafoodMarket.java` in the Package Explorer to open the file in the editor.  

Update the `main` method to implement the following functionality:

1. Declare and initialize a `Scanner` to read input from the console.
2. Prompt for and read two doubles: (1) pounds of fish and (2) price per pound.  
3. Calculate the total cost as a double, rounding the value to 2 digits after the decimal point.
4. Print the pounds, price per pound, and total cost as shown in the sample runs below.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Sample Run#1</th>
<th>Sample Run#2</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Enter pounds of fish and price per pound: <b>5 8.99</b><br>
5.0 lbs at $8.99 per lb = $44.95
</td>
<td>Enter pounds of fish and price per pound: <b>3.25 15.99</b><br>
3.25 lbs at $15.99 per lb = $51.97
</td>

</tr>
</table>
