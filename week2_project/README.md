# CMSC 115 Week 2 Programming Projects


## Setup

TODO: ...


## Task 1 - SeafoodMarket.java

Double click on `SeafoodMarket.java` in the Package Explorer to open the file in the editor.  

Update the `main` method to implement the following functionality:

1. Declare and initialize a `Scanner` to read input from the console.
2. Prompt for and read two doubles: (1) pounds of fish and (2) price per pound.  
3. Calculate the total cost as a double, rounding the value to 2 digits after the decimal point.
4. Print the pounds, price per pound, and total cost as shown in the sample runs below.

<table>
<tr>
<th>Sample Run#1</th>
<th>Sample Run#2</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Enter pounds of fish and price per pound: <b>5 8.99</b><br>
5.0 lbs at $8.99 per lb = $44.95
</td>
<td>Enter pounds of fish and price per pound: <b>3.25 15.99</b><br>
3.25 lbs at $15.99 per lb = $51.97
</td>

</tr>
</table>

Run `SeafoodMarketTest` to confirm your solution passes the Junit tests.

Save and close any open files.


# Task #2 - NearestInt.java

Double click on `NearestInt.java` in the Package Explorer to open the file in the editor.  

Update the `main` method to implement the following functionality:

1. Declare and initialize a `Scanner` to read input from the console.
2. Prompt for and read two ints: (1) numerator and (2) denominator.  
3. Print the numeric conversions displayed in the sample runs 

<table>
<tr>
<th>Sample Run#1</th>
<th>Sample Run#2</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Enter numerator and denominator: <b>19 4</b><br>
Fraction: 19/4<br>
Double Value: 4.75<br>
Cast as Int: 4<br>
Rounded to nearest int: 5<br>
Negative Value: -4.75<br>
Negative Value rounded to nearest int: -5
</td>
<td>Enter numerator and denominator: <b>11 8</b><br>
Fraction: 11/8<br>
Double Value: 1.375<br>
Cast as Int: 1<br>
Rounded to nearest int: 1<br>
Negative Value: -1.375<br>
Negative Value rounded to nearest int: -1<br>
</td>

</tr>
</table>
